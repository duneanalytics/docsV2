# Abstractions

## What are abstractions?

Abstractions are custom tables that are maintained by Dune and our community. Our abstractions layer is managed in this public [github repository](https://github.com/duneanalytics/abstractions). The V2 instance of abstractions makes use of dbt to standardize, normalize and work with data across all blockchains dune has indexed.

**You, too can build an abstraction:**

{% content-ref url="../../how-does-dune-work/abstractions-in-dunev2/" %}
[abstractions-in-dunev2](../../how-does-dune-work/abstractions-in-dunev2/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
