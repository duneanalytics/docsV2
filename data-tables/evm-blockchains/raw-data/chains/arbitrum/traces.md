# Traces

## arbitrum.traces

Transactions can trigger smaller atomic actions that modify the internal state of an Ethereum Virtual Machine. Information about the execution of these actions is logged and can be found stored as an EVM execution trace, or just a _trace_. In Etherscan these are referred to as "internal transactions".

### Gas used in traces

The `gas_used` column in the arbitrum.traces table is a bit hard to understand, so here is some pointers:

* the `gas_used` of a trace will always include the gas consumed by the trace and all it's subtraces.
* the `gas_used` of the inital call will not contain the cost of making the call in the first place
  * you need to add X gas units + the cost of sending zero + non zero bytes to the `gas_used` value of the top trace to arrive at the "true" `gas_used` value.
  * for more reading on this please refer to this [stackexchange entry](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/31443/what-do-the-response-values-of-a-parity-trace-transaction-call-actually-repres)
