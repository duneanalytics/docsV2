# Transactions

## arbitrum.transactions

Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. Transactions will always originate from externally owned accounts, a smart contract can not initiate a transaction.

Transactions need to be broadcast to the whole network. Any node can broadcast a request for a transaction to be executed on the EVM; after this happens, a miner will execute the transaction and propagate the resulting state change to the rest of the network.
