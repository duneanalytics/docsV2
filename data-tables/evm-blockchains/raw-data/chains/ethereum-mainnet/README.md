# Ethereum Mainnet

Ethereum was first launched in 2015 and is the original Blockchain that innovated and implemented the Ethereum Vitrual Machine. Ethereum to this day remains a "truly" decentralized platform with many node operators all over the world securing the Blockchain. Ethereum is maintained and developed by independet developers all over the world.

Since it's inception in 2015, Ethereum has undergone a range of updates.

Explaining the Ethereum history, Roadmap and technical details goes beyond the scope of this documentation, therefore we encourage you to read the Documentation on [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/).
