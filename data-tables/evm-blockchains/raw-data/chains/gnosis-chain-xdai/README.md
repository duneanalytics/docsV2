# Gnosis Chain (xDai)

Gnosis Chain is the predeccseor of xDAI. It's a unique system in which the native fee currency is a bridged version of the stablecoin $DAI. The chain uses a unique dual-token model; $xDai is a stable token used for transactions, payments, and fees; Proof of Stake protection will be provided by $GNO with the consensus-layer Gnosis Beacon Chain.

Gnosis Chain is yet to complete it's transition to an open proof of stake system, in the meanwhile the chain is being maintained by the POSDAO. You can read more about this transitional state [here](https://developers.gnosischain.com/for-validators/consensus).

Gnosis Chain will continue xDaiâ€™s intent to follow the Ethereum roadmap as closely as possible. Future goals include:

* Offer the highest degree of compatibility between Gnosis Chain and Ethereum
* Set up a Gnosis Beacon Chain (in preparation of a later merge)
* Develop over time a role similar to what Kusama is to Polkadot

Gnosis Chain follows all standards and upgrades of Ethereum Mainnet, querying on Dune is exactly the same.
