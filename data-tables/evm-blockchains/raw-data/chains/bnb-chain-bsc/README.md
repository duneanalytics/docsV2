# BNB Chain (BSC)

BNB Chain(formerly Binance Smart Chain, BSC) is an instance of the Ethereum Virtual Machine built and maintained by a team from the popular Crypto Exchange [Binance](https://binance.com/). BNB Chain follows most of the rules of Ethereum Mainnet, but has not implemented EIP1559. Instead it relies on [BEP-95](https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP95.md) to burn fees that accrue during usage of the platform. Furthermore, the gas limit per block is set to 100 mio, enabling more transactions to be processed in a given block. Transactions fees are paid in $BNB instead of $ETH.

You can read more about BNB Chain in [the documentation](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/bnbIntro).

On Dune, that means that the gas fields for EIP1559 transactions stay empty, everything else is the same.
