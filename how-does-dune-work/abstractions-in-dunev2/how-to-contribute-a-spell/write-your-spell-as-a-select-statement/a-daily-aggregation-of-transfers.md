# A daily aggregation of transfers

This sums all transfers for the day. This table is materialized as an incrementally loaded table updated every 15 minutes because the next step includes a slower \`[window](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-window.html)\` function to capture a rolling sum.

There’s a few novel components to make this spell incremental:

The `<div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="if"> </div>` JINJA block allows us to add an arbitrary filter when running in “incremental” mode. Incremental mode is default and a full refresh is denoted by a command line arg to completely recreate the table.

Here we use this block to filter for all data timestamped in the last two days. We are running this model every fifteen minutes, but we allow a look back of 2 days to account for data arriving late from the blockchain.

Does that create duplicates? It would, but we are also using a “`merge`” incremental\_strategy. Merge strategies require a unique key and deduplicate the table upon each update. You’ll see above in the transfers view, we created our own `'unique_transfer_id'` by coalescing several transfer features together that we utilize here.

You’ll also note that this is the first use of “refs” in this spellset. A ref, like `{{ ref('tokens_ethereum_erc20') }}` is simply a reference to another model in the DBT project. It doesn’t matter what the name of the view or table is. The ref references the name of the file itself. That means, we can’t have duplicate file names.
