# Rolling sum of daily transfers

The next step is to apply the rolling sum window function to each daily transfer sum. This is a pretty straightforward query. We’d end here for balances if it was guaranteed that each wallet/contract pair made a transfer every day. But since that’s not the case we’ll finish the spell in the next model by filling in all the missing days and doing a few more clean up steps.
