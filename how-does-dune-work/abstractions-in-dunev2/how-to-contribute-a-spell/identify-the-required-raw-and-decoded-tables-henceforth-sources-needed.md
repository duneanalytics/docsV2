# ðŸ“™ Identify the required raw and decoded tables (henceforth sources) needed

[ERC-20 ](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)tokens are fungible tokens that all follow a contract standard set by the Ethereum Foundation. To track daily balances, we need to first identify the transfers.

The main base Dune table weâ€™ll use for this purpose is `erc20_ethereum.evt_Transfer` which you can find via the data explorer.a

Then, in the Spellbook project, the source must be defined in a YAML file. We define this source in [base\_sources/ethereum\_base\_sources.yml.](https://github.com/duneanalytics/abstractions/blob/master/spellbook/models/base\_sources/ethereum\_base\_sources.yml) Once a source has been defined it does not need to be defined again.

Defining a source can be as simple as adding its schema and name. But to harness the full power of the tool, weâ€™ll also want to define tests, freshness checks, and add column descriptions.

Define the table name and description under the schema.

```yaml
 sources:
  - name: erc20_ethereum
    description: "Transfers events for ERC20 tokens."
    tables:
      - name: evt_transfer
```

Add a freshness check. Freshness checks use a timestamp type field to validate when the last rows of data were loaded. Here weâ€™ll use `evt_block_time` and use the DBT default warning and error checks.

```yaml
sources:
  - name: erc20_ethereum
    description: "Transfers events for ERC20 tokens."
    tables:
      - name: evt_transfer
        loaded_at_field: evt_block_time
        description: "Transfers events for ERC20 tokens."
        freshness:
          warn_after: { count: 12, period: hour }
          error_after: { count: 24, period: hour }
```

Add column descriptions and tests. Regarding tests, generally, youâ€™ll want to make the primary key both unique and non\_null.

You can use an ampersand anchor `&` before a column name to reuse its description later in the same YAML file.

`*`column name will reuse the column description defined earlier.

```yaml
sources:
  - name: erc20_ethereum
    description: "Transfers events for ERC20 tokens."
    tables:
      - name: evt_transfer
        loaded_at_field: evt_block_time
        description: "Transfers events for ERC20 tokens."
        freshness:
          warn_after: { count: 12, period: hour }
          error_after: { count: 24, period: hour }
        columns:
        - name: contract_address
          description: "ERC20 token contract address"       
        - &evt_tx_hash
          name: evt_tx_hash
          description: "Transaction hash of the event"
        - &evt_index
          name: evt_index
          description: "Event index"   
        - &evt_block_time
          name: evt_block_time
          description: "Timestamp for block event time in UTC"
        - &evt_block_number
          name: evt_block_number
          description: "Event block number"  
        - *from
        - *to
        - name: value
          description: "Amount of ERC20 token transferred" 
```

These descriptions are rendered in the docs by dbt. Locally, you can open them by running `dbt docs generate` and `dbt docs serve` from your CLI in the spellbook directory. Soon they will be hosted on dune.com for all wizards to use.
